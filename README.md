# Two-Assets-Portfolio-Optimization
Two Assets Portfolio Optimization using Markowitz Model. This is the implementation of Two assets portfolio optimization. It takes data of two assets of any company and based on some standard portfolios, gives the most optimized portfolio in terms of risk to return ratio as output.\

It even plots the graph of the different portfolios.\

We have taken the data of Apollo Hospitals and Vanguard group to demonstrate two different portfolio model and to study the effect of Covid-19 on the shares of Apollo Hospital.\
We saw that the stock prices of Apollo Hospital have
seen a significant amount of rise in recent times which is a clear
indication that Covid-19 affected the stock market but the effect
was positive in case of businesses working in Healthcare
department, whereas in Vanguard’s case, the increase in price of
stocks shows much more uniformity.\
Analysing the bond prices, we saw that the scenario is reversed
as Bond prices of Apollo Hospital shows a uniform increase
whereas the Vanguard’s graph is irregular. One of the reasons
behind this might be that the dataset we have undertaken in case
of Apollo Market is quite small as it consists of data from last 2
years only, while the dataset of Vanguard Company comprises of
last 10 years.
